Your roof takes the brunt of everything—rain, snow, wind, hail, falling trees. So when it’s damaged, a big question comes up fast: **Will my homeowners insurance cover the cost to replace it?**

The short answer is: **sometimes.** It depends on what caused the damage, how old your roof is, and what kind of policy you have.

At **Hybrid Roofing & Renovations**, we’ve helped hundreds of Pennsylvania homeowners navigate the insurance process after storm damage or unexpected roof failure. Here's what you need to know before you file a claim—or before you assume you'll be paying out of pocket.





## **When Does Homeowners Insurance Cover Roof Replacement?**

Most standard homeowners insurance policies **do cover roof replacement** if the damage is caused by a *sudden, accidental event*. This includes things like:

* **Storm damage** from high winds, hail, or heavy snow


* **Falling trees or branches**


* **Fire or lightning**


* **Vandalism**



If your roof was in good condition before the event and the cause of damage is listed in your policy, your insurance should cover the costs to repair or replace the roof.

**Example:**
 If a windstorm rips off half your shingles or a tree crashes through the roof during a storm, that's usually covered. In these cases, your insurance may pay for a full roof replacement, depending on the extent of the damage.





## **When It’s *Not* Covered**

Homeowners insurance won’t cover roof damage if the cause is something considered preventable or related to lack of maintenance.

That includes:

* **Old age or normal wear and tear**


* **Leaks caused by neglected repairs**


* **Improper installation**


* **Moss, mold, or rot from poor upkeep**



In other words, if your 25-year-old roof finally gives out or starts leaking due to old shingles, your insurance likely won’t help. That’s why **regular inspections and maintenance matter**—so you can catch issues before they become your responsibility.





## **Actual Cash Value vs. Replacement Cost Coverage**

Not all policies are created equal. Some will cover the **full replacement cost** of your roof, while others will only pay the **depreciated value** based on its age and condition.

### **1. Replacement Cost Value (RCV)**

This means your insurer pays what it costs to fully replace your roof with materials of similar kind and quality, minus your deductible.

**Best-case scenario:** You pay your deductible, and insurance covers the rest.

### **2. Actual Cash Value (ACV)**

This means your insurer pays what your roof is worth *today* after depreciation.

**Example:** If your roof is 15 years old and only valued at $4,000, but replacing it costs $12,000—you’re only getting $4,000 (minus your deductible), and you're paying the rest.

**Tip:** Check your policy and ask your agent whether your roof is covered under ACV or RCV. It can make a huge difference when it’s time to file a claim.





## **How the Insurance Claim Process Works**

If you think your roof has storm damage or another covered issue, here’s what to do:

### **1. Get a Professional Roof Inspection**

This is where **Hybrid Roofing & Renovations** comes in. We’ll inspect your roof for free, document any damage, and give you an honest assessment of whether it looks like an insurance-worthy claim.

### **2. File a Claim With Your Insurance Company**

Once you’ve confirmed the damage is likely covered, call your insurer and file a claim. They’ll assign an adjuster to assess the damage.

### **3. Meet With the Adjuster**

We’re happy to meet with the insurance adjuster at your home to make sure they see all the damage and have accurate documentation.

### **4. Get Approval and Start the Work**

If the claim is approved, you’ll receive a payout based on your policy. Then we’ll schedule the replacement, handle the paperwork, and get the job done quickly and professionally.





## **Common Questions We Hear**

### **What if only part of the roof is damaged?**

Even if the damage is limited to one section, your insurer might approve a full replacement if matching materials aren’t available or the damage affects overall performance.

### **Will my premiums go up if I file a claim?**

Possibly, but it depends on your insurer and whether the damage is considered an “act of nature.” Claims for storm damage typically won’t raise your rates as much as claims for neglect or preventable damage.

### **How long does the insurance claim process take?**

It varies, but typically 1 to 3 weeks from inspection to approval. Once approved, we can usually schedule and complete the replacement quickly—weather permitting.
